# Analysing the attack
Analyse the data of the malware attack to identify how the malware spreads. Find patterns used by the attacker so that we can prepare a firewall rule to stop the spread of the virus.

## Here is the background information on your task

Now that you have notified the infrastructure owner of the current attack, analyse the firewall logs to find the pattern in the attacker’s network requests. You won’t be able to simply block IP addresses, because of the distributed nature of the attack, but maybe there is another characteristic of the request that is easy to block.

An important responsibility of an information security analyst is the ability to work across disciplines with multiple teams, both technical and non-technical.

In the resources section, we have attached a proof of concept payload that may be of interest in understanding how the attacker scripted this attack.

## Here is your task

First, analyse the firewall logs in the resources section.

[firewall logs](<Task 1_2 - Firewall_Infrastructure List.xlsx>)

Next, identify what characteristics of the Spring4Shell vulnerability have been used.

Finally, draft an email to the networks team with your findings. Make sure to be concise, so that they can develop the firewall rule to mitigate the attack. You can assume the recipient is technical and has dealt with these types of requests before.
